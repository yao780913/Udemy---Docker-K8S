Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!
# Create Dockerfile

2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.    

3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.
# 

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.
# docker container prune

5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.

6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.

/node-app
# docker build . -t hello:latest
    # docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name hello 7a6
    # docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --rm --name hello 7a6

/python-app
# docker build . -t calcbmi:1
    # docker run -it --rm calcbmi:1

    # docker run -it calcbmi:1
    # docker start -ai 34a
